AI Verify is an AI detection and fact-checking tool with the main goal being to address the rise of fake news by Gen AI, driven by technological advancements, legal constraints, and market gaps, as well as promoting digital media literacy.

## Abstract
With the growing rate of AI-generated content and the rapid spread of deepfakes and fabricated news, it is becoming increasingly challenging for users to differentiate between credible information and misinformation/disinformation. As stated under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are not held accountable for hosting political disinformation, creating an urgent need for reliable AI-generated content detection tools. Fake news—often created and distributed in various multimedia formats like videos and articles—is continuing to spread, so the general public must have access to effective fact-checking mechanisms to verify content and enhance digital media literacy.

Our project aims to address this challenge by designing a comprehensive AI detection and fact-checking tool that prioritizes trust, transparency, and usability. We conducted user research testing of existing AI detection tools which revealed critical barriers, including lack of confidence in AI-generated assessments, usability challenges, and verification behavior gaps. Our solution is targeted towards general users regardless of technical expertise, offering AI-generated content detection alongside government-related news fact-checking. The system's core functionalities are designed to support the entire user journey. Users can input multimedia content, and the detection process delivers probability-based results by integrating AI and human verification, referencing primary government sources and trusted news agencies. To enhance credibility, the tool includes verified markers and redirection to authoritative sources for further validation. By empowering users to navigate misinformation, our project promotes credibility and transparency in digital media to bridge the gap between technology and informed decision-making.
